# Generative_AI
This repository contains code and notebooks for exploring generative AI techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models.

## LLMs

LLMs are a type of neural network that can be trained on massive datasets of text and code. Once trained, LLMs can be used to:

* Generate text
* Translate languages
* Write different kinds of creative content
* Answer your questions in an informative way

## Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are a type of generative model that can be used to create images, videos, and other visual content. Diffusion models work by starting with a random noise image and then gradually adding noise to the image until it resembles the desired output.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have the following installed:

* Python 3
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
* Hugging Face Transformers
* NumPy

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```
pip install tensorflow
pip install torch
pip install transformers
pip install numpy
```

Once you have installed all of the required libraries, you can clone the repository and start exploring the code and notebooks.

## Code
